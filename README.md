# SAMPLE PRODUCT LANDING PAGE
## This is a simple landing page done in html + css.

This is a sample landing product for the [freeCodeCamp resposive web certification 2022](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) course.

The code was done using freeCodeCamp's website IDE.

This are the requirements for the project:

- Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding `id="header"`
- You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here)
- Within the `#header` element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`
- You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`
- When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
- You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`
- Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding `id="form"`
- Within the form, there is an input field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address
- The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
- The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
- Within the form, there is a `submit` input with a corresponding `id="submit"`
- When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)
- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
- Your product landing page should have at least one media query
- Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once

## Content
All media has been taken from their respective owner's websites.
There is no affiliation or relationship with the brand and products used on this website. They have been chose by chance.

## Code structure
style.css has been organized following the html up to down order. Therefore you will find the `<footer>` styling at the bottom and the `<header>` styling at the top. All children of any element are also below their parents. Also, media-queries are placed at the bottom since the design followed a [Mobile first design strategy](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-implement-mobile-first-design)
